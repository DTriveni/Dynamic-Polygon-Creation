### Polygon Visualizer - A Shiny App for Dynamic Polygon Creation

This Shiny app allows users to dynamically generate polygons with varying radius and number of sides. The app features two sliders: one to adjust the radius of the polygon and another to control the number of sides. The polygon is rendered in real-time based on these inputs, giving an interactive way to visualize different polygon shapes.

#### Features:
- **Interactive UI**: Sliders for adjusting the radius and number of sides of the polygon.
- **Real-time Rendering**: Polygons are dynamically generated and displayed as users adjust the parameters.
- **Customizable Shapes**: From triangles to 20-sided polygons, the app supports a wide range of polygon configurations.

#### How to Use:
1. Adjust the radius using the "Varying Radius" slider.
2. Set the number of sides with the "Number of Sides" slider.
3. Watch the polygon update in real-time on the plot.
